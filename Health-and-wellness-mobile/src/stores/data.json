                "question": "If a student shares something in confidence, is it ok for me to tell someone else if I am concerned?",
                "answer": "Many students turn to trusted faculty or staff when in distress or in need of support. And because they interact with students regularly, faculty or staff are often the first to observe concerning changes in students’ mood or behavior.  We know that it can be difficult to break confidence, which is why it is important to never promise a student confidentiality.  It is appropriate to consult with the University Counseling Center about concerns that arise, especially when those concerns involve student safety. Our clinical staff can provide you with information to help you address the situation on your own, or can instigate important next steps to ensure student well-being.  Ultimately, it is important to remember that information that students share with faculty and staff is not confidential, and that the UCC staff is available to assist if you are unsure of how to handle a student concern."

                "question": "I want to make sure the student I reffered is safe/got help. Is this possible?",
                "answer": "Due to legal and ethical requirements, and the confidential nature of the client/counselor relationship, the University Counseling Center staff cannot share whether or not a student attended a session or received mental health services. Depending on your role and the nature of your relationship with the student, it can be helpful to check in with them after making a referral. Consider asking: \n“How have things been going since we last talked?” \n“Did you have a chance to talk to anyone yet?”\nIt may also be appropriate to share your concerns about a student with the Dean of Students CARE Team by filing a Care Report [Link: www.gvsu.edu/care]. The CARE Team is able to follow-up with students, whereas the University Counseling Center is generally unable to make contact with a student who has not initiated services."

For you and other members of the faculty/staff: \nIf there is an immediate threat to self or others, call 911 or GVPD (616) 331-3255\nThe Human Resources Office offers free mental health services to University employees through Encompass [link www.gvsu.edu/hro] Faculty and staff can access the University Counseling Center community provider database for assistance in identifying a clinician who meets their needs [link www.gvsu.edu/counsel/community]. For family members or loved ones:\nIf there is an immediate threat to self or others, call 911.\nUtilize the University Counseling Center community provider database [link www.gvsu.edu/counsel/community] for West Michigan mental health resources\nVisit Psychology Today [link www.psychologytoday.com] to search for clinicians across the country."

The CARE Team (Coordination, Assistance, Response, and Education) is comprised of professional staff members who support all students through challenges they may experience during their time at GVSU. Please complete a CARE Report [Link: www.gvsu.edu/care] if you are concerned about a student or know a student who needs support."

                "answer": "All first-time student appointments are scheduled within two business days. These screening appointments assess student concerns, identify risk, and connect students with appropriate services. After their initial appointment, students who elect to continue counseling through the University Counseling Center will be scheduled for an intake.  Intakes are generally scheduled no more than two weeks out, though those with special requests may wait longer.  If students need to be seen more quickly, a counselor will assist them in finding a provider in the community who may better meet their needs."
