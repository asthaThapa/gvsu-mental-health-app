This is called box breathing.\nEncourage them to use grounding techniques\n-    Have the student sit down in a chair with their feet on the floor.  Offer the student a glass of water, if able.  One of the following grounding techniques may also be helpful:\n-Ask them to describe an object in the room in great detail.  It might be an object that they hold or one that they can see.                     -    Gently encourage them identify 5 things that they can see, 4 things that they can feel, 3 things that they can hear, 2 things that they can smell, and 1 thing that they can taste as a way to recenter their attention.\nSay these reassuring things\n- “You can get through this”\n- “Just concentrate on your breathing”- “Stay in the present”\n- “This feeling will not last forever”\n- “You are safe”\nConnect with help\n-    If the student is in need of immediate assistance, connect with available emergency services using the “I Have an Emergency” button below.\n- If the student is not in immediate assistance, below are additional campus resources that may be helpful.\n"

It is appropriate to consult with the University Counseling Center about student mental health concerns that arise, especially when those concerns involve student safety. This is not a breach of student confidentiality. Our clinical staff can provide you with information to address the situation on your own, or can instigate important next steps to ensure student well-being."

These screening appointments assess student concerns, identify risk, and connect students with appropriate services. After their initial appointment, students who elect to continue counseling through the University Counseling Center will be scheduled for an intake.  Intakes are generally scheduled no more than two weeks out, though those with special requests may wait longer.  If students need to be seen more quickly, a counselor will assist them in finding a provider in the community who may better meet their needs."

Those facing food insecurity can use the on-campus food pantry, Replenish, as well! * Link to Campus Dining and Replenish\n- Boundaries: A lot of students struggle to say “no” to family, friends, and opportunities for fun in college.
