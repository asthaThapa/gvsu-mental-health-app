Feeling anxious is an expectable and healthy (albeit unpleasant) response to life’s stressors. . .and can even be helpful sometimes.  If someone is anxious about a big test, they might study more.  If someone is anxious that they’ve done something wrong, they might go out of their way to make amends.  If someone is anxious about getting hurt, they might take extra precautions to protect themselves.  For some, though, anxiety can go from helpful to harmful.  Generally speaking, anxiety that is disproportionate to the situation, does not go away after the threat is gone, or makes it hard to fully engage in daily activities may be a sign of an anxiety disorder.\nThere are many anxiety disorders, including generalized anxiety, social anxiety, test anxiety, and phobias.  It is important to remember that anxiety may present differently in different people.",

Depression is a persistent feeling of sadness, apathy, or hopelessness, and it isn’t always in response to something bad that’s happened.  Many people feel depressed despite the positive things in their lives.  Depression can impact the way people feel, as well as the way that they think and the things that they do – often in ways that feel outside of their control.\nThere are different forms of depression, such as seasonal depression, dysthymia, postpardum depression, and bipolar disorder.

        "question": "If a student shares something in confidence, is it ok for me to tell someone else if I am concerned?",
        "answer": "Because they interact with students regularly, faculty and staff are often the first to notice concerning changes in students’ mood or behavior. It is appropriate to consult with the University Counseling Center about student mental health concerns that arise, especially when those concerns involve student safety. This is not a breach of student confidentiality. Our clinical staff can provide you with information to address the situation. If your attempts are not successful, you may file a CARE Report to instigate next steps to ensure student well-being."

      {
        "question": "What is a CARE Report and when should I file one?",
        "answer": "While attending GVSU, students may experience a variety of concerns, including academic distress, financial insecurity, inability to meet basic needs, physical illness, mental health symptoms, bias incidents, housing instability, relationship difficulties, and disruptive or disturbing behavior, among others. The CARE Team (Coordination, Assistance, Response, and Education) is comprised of professional staff members who support all students through challenges they may experience during their time at GVSU. Please complete a [link https://cm.maxient.com/reportingform.php?GrandValley&layout_id=2, placeholder: CARE Report] if the student needs more assistance than you are able to provide."
      },
      {
        "question": "I want to make sure the student I referred is safe/got help. Is this possible?",
        "answer": "As licensed healthcare professionals, the University Counseling Center staff cannot legally share whether a student attended a session or received mental health services. If appropriate to your role and/or the nature of your relationship with the student, we encourage you to check in with them after making a referral. Consider asking:\n- How have things been going since we last talked?\n- Did you have a chance to talk to anyone yet?"
      },
      {
        "question": "What if I'm worried about someone who is not a student (myself, a faculty or staff member, etc.)?",
        "answer": "Although the University Counseling Center only provides treatment to currently enrolled students, there are many resources available to others who may be struggling with their mental health. For you and other members of the faculty/staff: \n- If there is an immediate threat to self or others, call 911 or GVPD at [phone 616-331-3255].\n- The Human Resources Office offers free mental health services to University employees through Encompass [link https://www.gvsu.edu/hro/].\n For family members or loved ones:\n- If there is an immediate threat to self or others, call 911.\n- For West Michigan mental health resources, visit Psychology Today [link https://www.psychologytoday.com]."

      },
      {
        "question": "How long does it take for a student to be seen at the University Counseling Center?",
        "answer": "All first-time student appointments are scheduled within two business days. These screening appointments assess student concerns, identify risk, and connect students with appropriate services, which may include individual counseling, group counseling, symptom management resources, or referral to a community provider. If referred to individual counseling, appointments are generally scheduled no more than two weeks out. Group counseling is available throughout the semester. If students need to be seen more quickly, a counselor will assist them in finding a provider in the community who may better meet their needs."
